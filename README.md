SketchScreen
=======

Mozilla's Flame phone just got released, which runs FirefoxOS.
In the light of that event, a HackWeekDay was organised at [HITB](http://hackinthebox.org) AMS 2014.

This app extends the default [Gaia](https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia) Homescreen app by adding a button that allows you to make a sketch and submit it to the community. It will show sketches of other people in the background, much like a dynamic wallpaper.
